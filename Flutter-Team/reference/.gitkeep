# Reference Folder

This folder is for storing reference materials during development:
- Cloned open source apps
- Example app screenshots
- UI/UX inspiration
- Code snippets for learning
- Documentation from other sources
- Competitor app analysis

## Important

This folder is EXCLUDED from git tracking because:
1. Reference materials may be copyrighted
2. Prevents accidental commits of proprietary content
3. Keeps the repository clean and original
4. Cloned repos have their own .git history

## Suggested Structure

```
reference/
├── repos/              # Cloned open source repositories
│   ├── flutter-app-1/  # Example: git clone https://github.com/user/app
│   ├── flutter-app-2/
│   └── README.md       # Notes on what each repo is for
├── apps/               # Screenshots, APKs for reference
├── docs/               # External documentation, PDFs
├── code-snippets/      # Code examples for learning
├── ui-inspiration/     # Design references, Figma exports
└── notes/              # Personal notes, analysis
```

## How to Add a Cloned Repo

```bash
cd reference/repos
git clone https://github.com/user/some-flutter-app.git
```

The cloned repo keeps its own .git history, but won't affect your project's git.

## Warning

Do NOT directly copy content from this folder into your app.
Use it for learning and inspiration only.
The Originality Reviewer will flag copied content.
