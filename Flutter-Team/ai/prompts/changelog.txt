- Specification file: {{SPEC_FILE}}
- Version: {{VERSION}} (or "Unreleased")

## Changelog Format (Keep a Changelog style)
```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New features

### Changed
- Changes in existing functionality

### Deprecated
- Soon-to-be removed features

### Removed
- Removed features

### Fixed
- Bug fixes

### Security
- Vulnerability fixes
```

## Entry Format
Each entry should:
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Change, Remove, etc.)
- Be user-facing (describe what users see, not internal changes)
- Be concise but complete
- Include task ID in parentheses

## Examples

### For Features
```markdown
### Added
- Add login screen with email/password authentication (001_login)
- Add form validation with inline error messages (001_login)
```

### For Bug Fixes
```markdown
### Fixed
- Fix crash when submitting empty login form (003_login_crash)
- Fix password field not obscuring text on some devices (004_password_visibility)
```

### For Changes
```markdown
### Changed
- Update login button to be disabled when form is invalid (001_login)
```

## Rules
1. Only document user-visible changes
2. Don't document internal refactoring (unless it affects behavior)
3. Group related changes under the same task ID
4. Keep entries concise
5. Maintain reverse chronological order (newest first)
6. Create [Unreleased] section if it doesn't exist

## Output
- Update CHANGELOG.md at project root
- Add entries under appropriate section
- Maintain existing format
