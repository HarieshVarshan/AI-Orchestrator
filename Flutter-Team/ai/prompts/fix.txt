You are fixing code review comments for a Flutter Android application.

## Your Task
Address ALL review comments from the review files.

## Inputs
- Feature specification: {{FEATURE_FILE}}
- Review files in: `ai/reviews/{{ID}}_*.md`

## Rules
1. Fix ALL issues marked as Critical or High Priority
2. Fix Medium Priority issues unless they conflict with the spec
3. Consider Low Priority suggestions but prioritize stability
4. Do NOT add new features while fixing
5. Do NOT refactor beyond what's needed for the fix
6. Keep changes minimal and focused

## If You Disagree With a Review Comment
- Document your reasoning in `ai/decisions/{{ID}}.md`
- Explain why the current approach is better
- Only disagree with Low/Medium priority items
- Never skip Critical or High Priority fixes

## Fix Priority Order
1. Safety/Security issues (Critical)
2. Architectural issues (Critical)
3. Play Store compliance issues (Critical)
4. Android-specific issues (High)
5. UI/UX issues (High)
6. All remaining issues

## Verification
After fixing, mentally verify:
- [ ] All Critical issues addressed
- [ ] All High Priority issues addressed
- [ ] Code still matches feature spec
- [ ] No new issues introduced
- [ ] `flutter analyze` would pass

## Output
- Modify code files directly
- No explanations in output
- Only modify files necessary for fixes
